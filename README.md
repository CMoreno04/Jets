# Jets

## Third week homework for Skill Distillery

## Overview
This application will give you the options to display current jets in the fleet, fly these jets, view the fastest jet and the jet with the longest range, execute specific commands of these jets depending on specific class, add a new jet to the fleet or remove one, choose a specific jet to fly, hire a pilot and write a new .txt file to save your current list.

## Technologies/topics used
* Abstraction
* Polymorphism
* Inheritance
* Encapsulation
* ArrayList
* BufferedReader/BufferedWriter
* FileReader/FileWriter
* Iteration
* Down Casting
* Instantiation
* Exceptions
* Try/Catch/Finally
* Math.random();

##  Lessons
* Down cast an object then use instanceOf to sort trough these object and find the specific class that was needed.

* BufferWriter use, I had to create a separate toString in Jet class to format objects into text file.

* Utilized Math.random() to randomly assign names, initially I had it in a sequential order, but a used object.get((int)(Math.random() * 11). This helped me to choose a random name from the list without going out of bounds.

* Utilized interface to include specific methods on individual classes.

* Don't underestimate myself. I really thought that some of the stretch goals where unattainable, but proved myself wrong by accomplishing all of them.
