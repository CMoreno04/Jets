# Jets

## Third week homework for Skill Distillery

## Overview
### This application will give you the options to display jets in a file, fly these jets, view the fastest jet and the jet with the longest range, execute specific commands of these jets depending on specific class, add a new jet to the fleet or remove one, choose a specific jet to fly, hire a pilot and write a new .txt file to save your current list.

## Technologies/topics used
### ArrayList
### BufferedReader/BufferedWriter
### FileReader/FileWriter
### Iteration
### Down Casting
### Instantiation
### Exception
### Try/Catch/Finally
### Math.random();

##  Lessons
### Down cast an object then use instanceOf to sort trough these object and find the specific class that was needed.

### BufferWriter use, I had to create a separate toString in Jet class to format objects into text file.

### Utilized Math.random() to randomly assign names, initially I had it in a sequential order, but a used object.get((int)(Math.random() * 11). This helped me to choose a random name from the list without going out of bounds.

### Utilized interface to include specific methods on individual classes.

### Don't underestimate myself. I really thought that some of the stretch goals where unattainable, but really proved myself wrong there by accomplishing all of them.
